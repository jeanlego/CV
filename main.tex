        During my master's in Computer Science, I have gained expertise in language runtimes and FPGA development.
        My broad interests allow me to use lateral thinking to solve complex problems.
        I can efficiently visualize problems, design solutions, and communicate abstract ideas, allowing me to be an effective team member.
        My experience in academia and working as a senior developer has shaped me into an effective teacher.
        Working on both commercial and open-source projects has made me adaptable to new workflows.

    I have worked on both commercial and open-source tools.
    My broad interest allows me to have an open mind about different topics and use lateral thinking to solve complex problems.
    I have done my undergraduate and master's at the University of New Brunswick, and I am now looking for new opportunities.

    During my undergraduate degree, I met a teacher that sparked my desire to do research.
    I tailored my undergraduate for this research and, two years later, applied to an honours with the Centre for Advanced Studies--Atlantic. 
    The CASA research group offered me a scholarship for a master's on the Eclipse OMR project.
    Throughout my Masters, I became the maintainer of the Odin II project and co-authored five papers on the subject.
    I became responsible for training summer, honours, masters, and Ph.D. students for Odin II.
    During the summer of 2019, an opportunity opened up to teach, and I had three weeks to prepare.
    I was responsible for teaching 70 students about C for their first time; 
    Within six weeks, I taught them memory management (stack vs heap memory), git, Makefiles, Bison, and Flex.
    I loved every bit of it: the long nights preparing and reviewing material, and the open office door to help students.

    I have grown significantly at the CASA group but have started to stagnate.
    In applying to do my Ph.D. under you, I wish to increase my breadth of knowledge and get new opportunities to teach and publish.
    I am grateful that you took the time to read this and am looking forward to hearing from you.\\

    \noindent Sincerely,\\
    \indent Jean-Philippe Legault
