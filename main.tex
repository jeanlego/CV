	During my master's in Computer Science, I have gained expertise in language runtimes and FPGA development.
	My broad interests allow me to use lateral thinking to solve complex problems.
	I can efficiently visualize problems, design solutions, and communicate abstract ideas, allowing me to be an effective team member.
	My experience in academia, working two years as a senior, and as a lead developer, has shaped me into an effective leader.
	Working on both commercial and open-source projects has made me adaptable to new workflows.

	I have worked on both commercial and open-source tools.
	My broad interest allows me to have an open mind about different topics and use lateral thinking to solve complex problems.
	I have done my undergraduate and master's at the University of New Brunswick, and I am now looking for new opportunities.

	During my undergraduate degree, I met a teacher that sparked my desire to do research.
	I tailored my undergraduate for this research and, two years later, applied to do an Honours with the Centre for Advanced Studies--Atlantic.
	The CASA research group offered me a scholarship for a master's on the Eclipse OMR project.
	Throughout my Masters, I became the maintainer of the Odin II project and co-authored five papers on the subject.
	I became responsible for training summer, masters, and Ph.D. students for Odin II.
	During the summer of 2019, an opportunity opened up to teach, and I had three weeks to prepare.
	I was responsible for teaching 70 students about C for their first time;
	Within six weeks, I taught them memory management (stack vs heap memory), git, Makefiles, Bison, and Flex.
	I loved every bit of it: the long nights preparing and reviewing material and the open office door to help students.

	I have grown significantly at the CASA group but have started to stagnate.
	In applying to do my Ph.D. under you, I wish to increase my breadth of knowledge and get new opportunities to teach and publish.
	I am grateful that you took the time to read this and am looking forward to hearing from you.\\

	\noindent Sincerely,\\
	\indent Jean-Philippe Legault
