During my master's in Computer Science, I have gained expertise in
language runtimes and FPGA development. My broad interests allow me to
use lateral thinking to solve complex problems. I can efficiently
visualize problems, design solutions, and communicate abstract ideas,
allowing me to be an effective team member. My experience in academia,
working two years as a senior, and as a lead developer, has shaped me
into an effective leader. Working on both commercial and open-source
projects has made me adaptable to new workflows.

2018 -- cur. Master in Computer Science University of New Brunswick \|
NB, Canada

Finished courses and thesis, will defend on November 2020:

FPGA CAD tool (CS6999)

Project-based: Redesign sequential logic synthesis to support multiple
clock domain and multiple edge sensitivity in Odin II.

Operating Systems (CS6605)

A comprehensive study of computer operating systems: process
synchronization, concurrency, multi-processor systems, virtual memory,
advanced file systems, distributed systems. Design an i386 multi-tasking
Kernel.

Machine Learning & Data Mining (CS6735)

Cover: inductive inference of decision trees, neural network learning,
statistical learning methods, generic algorithms, Bayesian methods,
Information-Theoretic classification, and reinforcement learning. Focus
on theoretical concepts of machine learning such as inductive bias, the
PAC learning framework, Occam's razor, models of noise, uniform
convergence, and Fourier analysis methods.

Dynamic Memory Management (CS6905)

Study a statically typed functional language and use it to write
interpreters and demonstrating these core concepts. Learn the main
techniques of memory management, including allocation, liveness
detection, reference counting, compaction, and generational collectors.

New Brunswick \| NB, Canada

Honours in FPGA Architecture Design:

Natural Language Processing (CS4765)

Topics include fundamental topics in natural language processing such as
n-gram language models, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, lexical
semantics, spelling correction, document classification. Students are
expected to implement and evaluate a variety of natural language
processing methods, as well as write reports describing their
implementations and their performance.

Intro to Parallel Processing (CS4745)

Parallel computer architectures, design and analysis of parallel
algorithms, parallel programming languages, case studies, selected
numerical and non-numerical applications.

Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CS4725)

Introduction to intelligent agent design, problem-solving using search
techniques, the use of mathematical logic for knowledge representation
and reasoning, decision making under uncertainty, machine learning
techniques.

Digital Logic Design (ECE2214)

This is an introductory course to practical aspects of digital systems
design. The course includes the design of digital circuits with CAD
tools and VHDL hardware description language.

2015 -- 2018 Electronic and Software Technician Canada Electronic Parts
Online Inc. \| Canada

Repairing electronic devices, i.e. smartphones, televisions, computers.

Played a significant role in increasing sales and revenue by increasing
outreach.

Broadened the company expertise in electronic repairs and introduced
tooling and techniques to repair devices with surface mount components.

Increased repairs success rate and revenue.

Introduced software-based repairs and debugging (i.e. reflashing lost
IMEI or CMOS)
