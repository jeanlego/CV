I have worked on both commercial and open-source tools.
My broad interests allow me to have an open mind about different topics and use lateral thinking to solve complex problems.
I have done my undergraduate and Master's at the University of New Brunswick, and I am now looking for new opportunities.

I acquired three years of studies in Aerospace Engineering at a college, lending me a solid background in mission-critical systems.
During my studies, I have acquired strong understanding and abilities in mechanical engineering concepts such as CAD design, assembly, metallurgy, and composite materials;
My first introduction to CAD tools quickly made me realize the potential and the drawbacks of the tools available; I changed vocation to computer science to learn to improve these.

My rapid growth since I started my Bachelor's (2015) is a testament to my desire and ability to learn and create.
My undergraduate Honour's on Verilog Synthesis has allowed me to continued to work on the Odin II project to which I became the maintainer; 
This has allowed me to learn lead software engineering skills such as designing, maintaining, and administering projects with remote developers.
I have contributed to numerous papers and mentored fellow researchers from Canada to New-Zealand.
The experience I have acquired working under IBM for my Master's has allowed me to learn to develop features for large scale projects and collaborate with team members worldwide.
My experience with RTL compilers (Verilog synthesis tool) and JIT compilers (JVM) gave me a profound understanding of how compilers and high-level languages operate.

Outside of computer science, electronics is my passion; I have been ``modding'' gaming consoles ever since I learned to solder back in elementary school.
I have professionally repaired household devices like power amplifiers, cellphones, televisions, motherboards.
I have experience working with surface mount components and understand the challenges they pose.
