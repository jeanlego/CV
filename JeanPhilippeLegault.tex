\runsection{statement of purpose}

Should I be given the opportunity to a doctoral degree with you, I believe we would both benefit.
I have worked on both commercial and open-source tools.
My broad interest allows me to have an open mind about different topics and use lateral thinking to solve complex problems.
I have done my undergraduate and master's at the University of New Brunswick, and I am now looking out for new opportunities.

During my undergraduate degree, I met a teacher that sparked my desire to do research.
I tailored my undergraduate for this research and, two years later, applied to an honours with the Centre for Advanced Studies--Atlantic. 
The CASA research group offered me a scholarship for a master's on the Eclipse OMR project.
Throughout my Masters, I became the maintainer of the Odin II project and co-authored five papers on the subject.
I became responsible for training summer, honours, masters, and Ph.D. students for Odin II.
During the summer of 2019, an opportunity opened up to teach, and I had three weeks to prepare.
I was responsible for teaching 70 students about C for their first time; 
Within six weeks, I taught them memory management (stack vs heap memory), git, Makefiles, Bison, and Flex.
I loved every bit of it: the long nights preparing and reviewing material, and the open office door to help students.

I have grown significantly at the CASA group but have started to stagnate.
In applying to do my Ph.D. under you, I wish to increase my breadth of knowledge and get new opportunities to teach and publish.
I am grateful that you took the time to read this and am looking forward to hearing from you.\\

\noindent Sincerely,\\
\indent Jean-Philippe Legault
