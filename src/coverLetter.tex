		I am an asset since I can easily mentor and learn remotely or on-site.
		I am a frank, loyal, and autonomous employee; I will take on many responsibilities as I strive to learn, share, and create.
		In applying to the position, I wish to increase my breadth of knowledge and get new opportunities.
		I am grateful that you took the time to read this and am looking forward to hearing from you.\\[6pt]
