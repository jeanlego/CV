## Usage

This repo contains a rolling release of my CV.
Feel free to fork and make it your own!

The build script will generate a matrix of CV and cover letters for you to publish to diferent companies.
I recommend you write one per company, but I've also include a way to make generic text files, that can be filled in with different entries in tools.
For now, it is rather bare-bones, the most important part was to use github actions to generate the CVs and be able to easily grab a copy or edit it from my phone on a whim.

Anywho! enjoy :) 

you're awesome
